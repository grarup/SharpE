    <summary>AvalonEdit is the WPF-based text editor used in SharpDevelop</summary>
    <releaseNotes>* License changed from LGPL to MIT
			* New Feature: Hide mouse cursor while typing (enabled by default)
			* New Feature: Highlight current line (disabled by default)
			* New Feature: Overstrike mode (disabled by default)
			* New Feature: 'underline' attribute in syntax highlighting definitions
			* AvalonEdit now raises the WPF DataObject attached events on clipboard and drag'n'drop operations.
			* Encoding detection now distinguishes between UTF-8 with BOM and UTF-8 without BOM. This prevents AvalonEdit from adding the BOM to existing UTF-8 files.
			* Improved handling of grapheme clusters. A base character followed by a combining mark is now treated as a single character by the caret movement logic.
			* Added RichText, RichTextModel and RichTextColorizer.
			* Renamed the VB highlighting mode from "VBNET" to "VB"
			* Changed IHighlighter API in order to support SharpDevelop's semantic C# highlighter
			* The regex-based highlighting engine was moved into its own class (HighlightingEngine) to be separated from the state-tracking logic in DocumentHighlighter.
			* Add FileName property to TextDocument class.
			* DocumentChangeEventArgs.RemovedText/InsertedText are now of type ITextSource instead of string.
			* The error-tolerant XML parser included with AvalonEdit was removed. An improved version of this parser is part of the NRefactory 5 project.
			* Removed some obsolete APIs.</releaseNotes>
